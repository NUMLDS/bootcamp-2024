This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

##Step 1

###Set-up
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


###Task 2: Explore Your Data
```{r}
#Check missing values
colSums(is.na(nys_acs))
colSums(is.na(nys_schools))
```
```{r}
#check duplicate values
sum(duplicated(nys_acs))
sum(duplicated(nys_schools))
```
```{r}
#check duplicate row detail
nys_schools[duplicated(nys_schools), ]
#checked in the dataframe, they are exact duplicates
```

```{r}
# drop duplicates
nys_schools_nodup <- nys_schools[!duplicated(nys_schools), ]
```

```{r}
# check data types
glimpse(nys_acs)
glimpse(nys_schools_nodup)
```
```{r}
#check data basic stats
summary(nys_acs)
summary(nys_schools_nodup)
```
```{r}
# count the number of -99s
sapply(nys_schools_nodup, function(x) {
  count <- sum(x == -99, na.rm = TRUE)
  percentage <- (count / length(x)) * 100
  c(Count = count, Percentage = percentage)
})
```

###Task 3: Recode variables
Deal with missing values
```{r}
# drop missing values -99 because the proportion of -99s in the total data is small (less than 10%), 2226 rows were removed
nys_schools_clean <- nys_schools_nodup[!apply(nys_schools_nodup == -99, 1, any), ]
```

```{r}
hist(nys_acs$county_per_poverty, breaks=50)
```
Create a categorical variable that groups counties into "high", "medium", and "low" poverty groups
```{r}
# Calculate the average poverty for each county
county_avg_poverty <- nys_acs %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarise(avg_poverty = mean(county_per_poverty, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r}
# Label the counties based on percentiles
county_avg_poverty <- county_avg_poverty %>%
  mutate(poverty_group = cut(
    avg_poverty, 
    breaks = quantile(avg_poverty, probs = c(0, 0.33, 0.66, 1), na.rm = TRUE), 
    labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
    include.lowest = TRUE
  ))
```

```{r}
# Merge the labels back to the original dataframe
nys_acs <- nys_acs %>%
  left_join(county_avg_poverty, by = "county_name")
```

```{r}
# get z-scores for math scores and ela score
nys_schools_clean <- nys_schools_clean %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(
    math_z = scale(mean_math_score, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE),
    ela_z = scale(mean_ela_score, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
  )
```

###Task 4: merge 2 datasets
```{r}
nys <- left_join(nys_schools_clean, nys_acs, by = c("county_name", "year"))
```

##Step 2 Analyze the data

###Task 5: create summary tables
For each county: total enrollment, percent of students qualifying for free or reduced price lunch, and percent of population in poverty
```{r}
county_summary <- nys %>%
  group_by(county_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_enrollment = sum(total_enroll, na.rm = TRUE),
    percent_free_lunch = mean(per_free_lunch, na.rm = TRUE),
    percent_reduced_lunch = mean(per_free_lunch, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_poverty = mean(county_per_poverty, na.rm=TRUE),
    mean_reading_score = mean(mean_ela_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_math_score = mean(mean_math_score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
county_summary
```

For the counties with the top 5 and bottom 5 poverty rate: percent of population in poverty, percent of students qualifying for free or reduced price lunch, mean reading score, and mean math score.
```{r}
# get corresponding counties
top_5_poverty <- county_summary %>%
  slice_max(avg_poverty, n = 5)

bottom_5_poverty <- county_summary %>%
  slice_min(avg_poverty, n = 5)

top_5_poverty
bottom_5_poverty
```
###Task 6 Data Visualization
Plot the relationship between access to free/reduced price lunch and test performance, at the school level.
```{r}
# check how many schools there are in the data
length(unique(nys$school_name))
```
```{r}
school_summary <- nys %>%
  group_by(school_name) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_per_free_lunch = mean(per_free_lunch, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_per_reduced_lunch = mean(per_reduced_lunch, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_ela_score = mean(mean_ela_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_math_score = mean(mean_math_score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r}
ggplot(school_summary, aes(x = mean_per_free_lunch + mean_per_reduced_lunch, y = mean_math_score)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Mean Percentage of Students Qualifying for Free or Reduced Lunch",
    y = "Mean Math Score",
    title = "Mean Math Score vs. Mean Percentage of Free/Reduced Lunch at Each School"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
```{r}
ggplot(school_summary, aes(x = mean_per_free_lunch + mean_per_reduced_lunch, y = mean_ela_score)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x = "Mean Percentage of Students Qualifying for Free or Reduced Lunch",
    y = "Mean Reading Score",
    title = "Mean Reading Score vs. Mean Percentage of Free/Reduced Lunch at Each School"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```
Plot average test performance across counties with high, low, and medium poverty

```{r}
#TBD
```
