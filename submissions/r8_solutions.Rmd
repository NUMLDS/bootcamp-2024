This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
names(nys_acs)
names(nys_schools)
str(nys_acs)
str(nys_schools)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
nys_schools <- nys_schools %>% filter(mean_ela_score != -99 & mean_math_score != -99& per_lep != -99 & per_free_lunch != -99 & per_reduced_lunch != -99 & total_enroll != -99)
summary(nys_schools)
  
```
```{r}
summary(nys_acs$county_per_poverty)
nys_acs <- nys_acs %>%
  mutate(Poverty_Status = case_when(
    county_per_poverty <=0.10903 ~ "Low",
    county_per_poverty >0.10903 & county_per_poverty <= 0.14929 ~"Medium"
    county_per_poverty > 0.14929 ~ "High"
  ))

head()
```
```{r}
counties_schools <- left_join(nys_acs, nys_schools, by= c("year", "county_name"))
head(counties_schools)
```


```{r}
counties_schools <- counties_schools %>%
  group_by(year, county_name) %>%
  summarize(sum(total_enroll))


```
```{r}
nys_schools <- nys_schools %>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x="per_free_lunch", y = "mean_ela_score",group = ))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
